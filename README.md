## Sentiment_Analyzer
Using custom string class I created, program trains analyzer to classify tweets with a positive or negative sentiment with a ~68.630% accuracy. 
*future additional functionality: 
- to increase accuracy: remove stop words and stem words
- to reduce run-time: replace ordered maps with unordered maps*
